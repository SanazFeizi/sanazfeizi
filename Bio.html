          Sanaz Feizi (she/her) is an Iranian interdisciplinary designer who
          examines gender-based issues, focusing on women and their embodied 
          subjectivities. Through her work, she explores the complex entanglements 
          between socio-cultural, (bio)medical, and (bio)political contexts
          that condition women to self-censorship and self-surveillance, thereby 
          thereby removing their authority and autonomy. Her design practice focuses 
          on making visible the internal and external forces that amplify 
          discrimination and violence.
          Sanaz holds an AA in Visual Arts and earned her BA and MA in Visual 
          Communication from Tehran, Iran. Beyond her academic achievements, Sanaz 
          has made significant contributions to the design community, having served
          as a graphic design instructor and collaborating with various reputable 
          design and animation corporations. Her work has garnered international 
          recognition, being showcased in esteemed exhibitions across several countries, 
          including Iran, the USA, Canada, Russia, and the UK.
          She obtained her MFA in Design from Mason Gross School of the Arts, and holds 
          a part-time lecturer position, sharing her expertise and passion for design 
          through teaching courses at Rutgers University.
