          Sanaz Feizi (she/her) is an Iranian interdisciplinary 
          designer who examines gender-based issues, focusing on 
          women and their embodied subjectivities. Through her 
          work, she explores the complex entanglements between 
          socio-cultural, (bio)medical, and (bio)political contexts 
          that condition women to self-censorship and self-surveillance, 
          thereby removing their authority and autonomy. Her design 
          practice focuses on making visible the internal and
          external forces that amplify discrimination and violence.
          Sanaz holds an AA in Visual Arts and earned her BA and MA 
          in Visual Communication from Tehran, Iran. With her background 
          in design and education, Sanaz has served as a graphic design 
          instructor and collaborated with various design and animation 
          corporations. Her work has been showcased both nationally and 
          internationally, including in Iran, the USA, Canada, Russia, and 
          the UK. She obtained her MFA in Design from Mason Gross School of the 
          Arts at Rutgers University and currently works as a part-time lecturer, 
          teaching design courses at the same institution.
