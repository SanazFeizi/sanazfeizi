          Human issues have always held great significance for me. 
          Over the course of my life, I have come to the realization 
          that simply creating forms is not enough to satisfy my creative 
          drive. Consequently, I have made it my mission to infuse my 
          artwork with concepts and meaning, using it as a platform for 
          addressing a range of socio-political and cultural concerns. My 
          ultimate goal is to stimulate reflection among viewers and inspire 
          positive action toward creating a world defined by peace and 
          tranquility. While I address a variety of issues in my work, such 
          as freedom of expression, child marriage, and world peace, I consider 
          women's issues to be at the core of my design practice.
