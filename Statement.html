          The pursuit of human issues has always held profound significance 
          in my life. As I've traversed my artistic journey, I've come to realize 
          that mere form creation cannot fully satisfy my creative drive. 
          Consequently, I've embarked on a mission to imbue my artwork with profound 
          concepts and meaning, utilizing it as a potent platform to address a wide 
          spectrum of socio-political and cultural concerns. 
          My ultimate aspiration is to ignite introspection among viewers, inspiring 
          positive action that shapes a world defined by peace and tranquility.
          Within my work, I delve into a diverse array of critical issues, including 
          freedom of expression, child marriage, and world peace. Yet, I find that 
          women's issues resonate at the very core of my design practice. Through my 
          artistic expression, I seek to elevate the voices and struggles of women, 
          advocating for gender equality and empowerment. 
          With each artistic endeavor, I plant the seeds of hope and progress, believing
          that through shared reflection and collective action, we can forge a world 
          where every individual thrives, regardless of gender, race, or background.
